For local Docker development, you should create a directory for the whole project. 
In this directory, use git clone to clone three repositories. 
The folders for each repository will be automatically created, so it's important to clone everything in the root folder.

After cloning the repositories, navigate to the GamePriceComparator.IAC folder, then to the Docker folder. 
There, you can start all the containers with the command:

docker-compose up --build
